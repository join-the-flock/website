# File an Issue

When you think that a bug should be fixed, or a feature should be added to Flock, the process begins
with filing an issue ticket. This guide describes how.

## 1. Try filing with Flutter first
Flock is a pressure release valve for Flutter. This means that the best place for a bug fix, and a
feature, is Flutter, itself. Before filing an issue with Flock, it's critical that you first [file
an issue with Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). Only if the Flutter team is unable or 
unwilling to address your issue should you file a ticket with Flock.

## 2. File a ticket for Flock
Locate the existing Flutter ticket that you think the Flock team should handle. You'll need that
when filing an issue ticket for Flock.

Open a new ticket in the [Nest repository](https://github.com/join-the-flock/nest/issues/new/choose).

The Nest repository is used both for Flock tickets, and Nest tickets.

When filing your issue, use one of the existing issue templates. One template is available for
bugs, and another template is available for features. Be sure to link to the original Flutter ticket
in your issue. Also, please carefully read each section in the template, and provide any information
that isn't available in the original Flutter ticket. Don't forget to choose a good title!

## 3. Wait for triage and analysis
The Flock team will likely take multiple passes over your issue ticket. 

First, the Flock team will check your issue for compliance with requirements. To avoid 
losing valuable time, please make sure you've provided all relevant information. The Flock team
will also categorize the area of Flutter where your ticket applies.

Second, once the issue appears to have all relevant information, the Flock team will decide whether
they think this bug fix or feature belongs in Flock. This includes consideration of maintenance
burden. This decision might require further conversation with you. Sometimes, this decision will
happen very quickly, other times, this decision might take some time for research.

## 4. Wait for the fix
Once the Flock team decides that your change belongs in Flock, the team will prioritize it  and 
begin to look for available labor to take care of it. 

Nobody is paid to work on Flock. We pull labor from charitable and dedicated members of the Flutter
community. Please set your expectations accordingly. Stay tuned to the issue ticket for updates.

## Escape hatch
It's possible that even the Flock team is unable to deliver on your needs in a timely manner. In
that case, [Nest](/nest) provides tools to make it easier for you to fork Flutter, yourself. With 
your own fork, you can solve your specific issue, on your schedule.
