On November 5th, 2024, I sat down with Vasiliy Zukanov to discuss my development history, Flock,
and Nest.

Vasiliy is the host of the [Tech Your Chance](https://www.youtube.com/@TechYourChance) YouTube channel.
Vasiliy works primarily as an Android developer, but has dabbled with Flutter, and hosts conversations
about a variety of tech topics.
